    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The sixth team have had good season this year. A solid core of players who played every week made things pretty simple for the captain.</p>

<p>The team was the best represented at club training with 6 or 7 players turning out each week. Thanks to Jimmy for attempting to get us to play hockey! I think it really did help, and we looked like we knew what we were doing a couple of times over the course of the season.</p>

<p>Results-wise we did well. Played 22, won 10, drew 4 finishing a very respectable 5th. Particularly pleasing was a positive goal difference of 11.</p>

<p>There were many highlights during the season. Neston scoring 4 own goals was helpful, and a hard fought 1 - 0 victory in Bangor stood out.</p>

<p>Our player of the season was Peter McNaught and his disco pants. Peter has improved massively as a player over the last couple of seasons. He trains every week, and I don't think he missed a game all season.</p>

<p>Top scorer was Dave Brooks. I'm not sure what this says about us as a team, but it was a good effort.</p>
