<div class="entry-content"><p><strong>First (long) match report of the season from our fearless leader. Never let it be said that he likes the sound of his own voice&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>A brand new season, a new division, new opposition and a new name. Bowdon 6 was now Bowdon 5, new and improved. After a successful season last year resulting in promotion. The goal this season is survival. Pre match it didn&#8217;t start well. The lose of Goal Keeper Dave Jefferies and two of the solid back four in Peter McNaught and last season Man of the Season Chris Gawne certainly didn&#8217;t help, we also lost last years quasi captain Frank Fallon, the team then lost actual captain Hatch to a stroke on Monday Night.</p>

<p>Their were positives. Some deadline day transfers were secured and two new members of the team made their league debuts. Will Corless and Ben Abbott came in to sure up the defence. Their was also a spot for the returning Ben Fallon, after a long injury. The goalkeeping crisis was solved by stealing a badger, James Mazarelo, affectionately known as Maza for typing purposes. After some interjection from Broken Captain Hatch, Acting captain Braithwaite re-jigged the line up to be:</p>

<pre><code>           Maza

Fallon, West, Abbott, Corless
         Braithwaite
      Bretton   Ankers
           Jago
   Manterfield Bailey

Subs: Prosser, Gadsby
</code></pre>

<p>New Manager Hatch took his spot on the sidelines, his personal Nurse accompanying him to make sure his blood pressure didn&#8217;t rise too high.</p>

<p>Bowdon started out surprisingly fast. Showing previous unheralded pace and verve putting today&#8217;s opposition on the back foot straight away. After being perennial slow starters last season it was a welcome surprise.</p>

<p>One other theme set early on was Cheshire understanding of how crap (slow) alty boys pitch really is. They hit everything, they might do this all the time, but today it worked wonders. Striking the ball cleanly, something Bowdon struggled with early on, a few mis-placed passes seeing the blood pressure rise.</p>

<p>Bowdon turned on the style soon, good movement down the left starting with Corless and Ankers allowed Jago to show off some skills before striking the ball inside the D, the umpire reliably informs me that the shot was going nowhere near the goal when it took a deflection off an opposition player and went in. The own goal rule now abolished any shot within the D counts if defected in, so this seasons first score was &#8230;Dale Jago. Embarrassing to the 4 strikers in the team.</p>

<p>Cheshire soon reduced themselves to 10 men, one of their players landing hard and in his eyes dislocating his shoulder. The Qualified nurse on the touchline showed no compassion and neither did Bowdon, I did try to get him ice but no one form Alty boys was around. If only they&#8217;d bought subs.</p>

<p>Bowdon pushed on however and soon started getting short corners. Nick Manterfield marked his return to the team with a nice strike into the back of the net. Cheshire finally started to play some hockey at two down and Maza was introduced to Adult Hockey after wondering what all the fuss was about. The young lad making some fine saves at both his near and far posts.</p>

<p>Bowdon capitalised on the fine work at the back by continuing to push forward earning more short corners. I&#8217;m sure the third goal was scored here, but I can&#8217;t remember who, West say, slotting home.</p>

<p>At this point Coach Brooks pointed out the good work that the team had done at training on Monday and how they were completely ignoring the tactics taught. Queue another short corner and a well worked slide ball left from Braithers, before Corless slammed home. A defender (actually) on the score sheet&#8230;.</p>

<p>It should be noted that for large portions of the first half Nick Manterfield played left back&#8230;.it was amazing to watch, not great for the blood pressure though.</p>

<p>Half Time: Bowdon 5&#8217;s 4 – 0 West Cheshire 2&#8217;s</p>

<p>After a rousing team talk and a slight tactical reshuffle. Bowdon went back out in search of more goals.</p>

<p>However it was West Cheshire who hit back first, some fine work moving the ball around the D forced a short corner from which they scored.</p>

<p>Bowdon re group quickly. Moving the ball well and with the theme of the second half being displayed regularly, both teams tiring long ball through the Swiss cheese middle creating a barrage of chances. Bowdon had to score and after a bit of a action in the middle involving Bailey, Manterfield and Prosser before Gadsby bundled home.</p>

<p>Cheshire tried to push back To stem the tide by they found keeper Maza in inspired form. Making a save with the kind of flexibility never seen before, at least not on the internet. He produced several more fantastic saves from short corners and pot shots.</p>

<p>Up next was contender for goal of the season. Another 3 on 2 break resulted in at least a short corner. From their the ball broke back to prosser at near top of the D. He lofted a slow looping ball back towards goal, the defender only needed to stand still for the ball to hit his stick but inexplicably took a Manterfield style swing and missed completely, the ball nesselled in the back of the net. Not since the opening day of last season had Bowdon scored more than 5 and they were out for blood.</p>

<p>But once again over eagerness to get the name of the score sheet cost Bowdon, far too high up the pitch a simple whack up field allowed South Cheshire to get their second of the game. Keeper Maza unfortunate to concede two.</p>

<p>Bowdon were not to be outdone and earned a questionable penalty flick. Good work from Nick Manterfield saw his burst into the D and attempt to get a shot away, an axe tackle from the wrong side should have been a short corner but referee Gareth was in a generous mode and gave a flick. Manters, checking for wind direction first, converted with ease.</p>

<p>With 15 to go, the shout went out to get more goals. Despite a number of 3 on 2 Bowdon failed to take their chance, making Manager Hatch very unhappy&#8230;.blood pressure rose.</p>

<p>Manters did hit the back of the net again, but from just inside the Yellow football D and not the white Hockey D that he insists on telling everyone. I think it was just Hat-trick avoidance.</p>

<p>The only notable last action was for Neil Bretton to regale some wood chopping actions on an opposition player, earning him the first yellow card of the season. The final whistle went seconds later and Bowdon had their first victory.</p>

<p>Final Score: Bowdon 5&#8217;s 7 – 2 South Cheshire 2&#8217;s</p>

<h4>Man of the Match</h4>

<p>For some outstanding saves: James Mazarelo</p>

<h4>The Dale Jago Dick of the Day Award</h4>

<p>Neil Bretton, Yellow card no doubting. Although Hat trick avoidance from Nick Manterfield was a close second.</p>

<p>Brilliant performance from the boys today. But it should have been double the 7 we scored. Too many 3 on 2&#8217;s. The strikers look like they never met each other. You don&#8217;t need to score all the goals. Assists are fine.</p>

<p>Lesson To learn: Look up, not all the time, just some of the time, especially when your on the ball.</p>

<p>Special thank to Andy B, for taking over this week.</p>
