  <div class="entry-content"><p>Better late than never. This week&#8217;s report is from Mr G. Perry</p>

<p>Bowdon visited one of the most beautiful hockey grounds in West Warrington for their game against Runcorn. Dale Jago was very fortunate as it&#8217;s was a home game in reality. The newly self appointed fascist dictator, Herr Mr I&#8217;m Not Sure Where I&#8217;m From Hatch gave one of the most unrousing team talks ever, pretty much destroying any morale which we had. As a direct result of such an uninspiring team talk we went one nil down. Thankfully Perry was on hand to level with a Gareth Bale-esque 59 yard weaving run and finish. Runcorn retook the lead, despite Freds dodgy touch the goal was still blamed on the captains poor prematch chat. At 2:1 Bowdon at half time the new skipper laid into his troops and got the reaction which his words commanded. A stunning second half display insued with 3 fine goals unanswered by the home team. The 4:2 final score may have flattered to deceive but in reality the discerning hockey brain knew that Bowdon had simply worn down the opposition to submission. The conclusion to the game was kindly summed up by words from Alan Hansen, a good team wins even when it is playing badly. Long may this fine run of bad form continue!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From the imagination of Mr N West&#8230;</p>

<p>The time had arrived once again for the 6th XI to step out onto the field of play.</p>

<p>How had the young pretender managed to galvanise the Ginger Maestro&#8217;s squad from a mid table team into title contenders?  Some might say it&#8217;s the introduction of his younger brother,  or has his minion Kyle installed alarms in the house which allow the skipper to arrive before the rest of the squad?</p>

<p>With the news that half the usual back 4 (Disco Pete &amp; Chris G), it turned out that Dale &#8216;The Dribbler&#8217; Jago &amp; Rick &#8216;The Stinger&#8217; Prosser had been drafted in as defensive cover.  Could The Dribbler curb his instincts &amp; maintain the discipline needed to keep our unbeaten record intact.</p>

<p>With young Ben &amp; Andy B controlling the midfield Kyle &amp; Neil were able to advance on either flank.  Although their crosses were often met by our forward duo they were ably kept out by the athleticism of the young Timperley keeper.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Timperley did manage to bypass the Ginger Maestro &amp; Ben which meant yours truly was forced to deflect the ball skilfully (or was it luck) past our goal.  It also led to me being given a green card, apparently putting your foot into the path of the ball is not the done thing!!! <em>(I think it was probably the complete lack of subtly that did for you. Your &#8216;Who me?&#8217; look was good though - AB)</em></p>

<p>After some good interplay between Ben &amp; Dave B the ball was put into the D for Andy Gadsby to bag a goal.  Half time score 1 0.</p>

<p>The 2nd half began with some neat interplay between Dave, Neil, Ben &amp; Andy G. These attacks were either snuffed out by the Timperley defence or put wide of the post.   Kyle decided try &amp; garner another nomination for DOTD by getting ahead of some of Neil&#8217;s crosses.  Unfortunately for he lost out to Neil who let out a girly scream when the Timperley keeper launched the ball in the direction of his dodgy knee. <em>(In Neil&#8217;s defence, the ball must have gone within 20m of him - AB)</em></p>

<p>Timperley managed to get forward on several occasions when Dale decided that playing at right back meant he could dribble from our own 22.  This forced both Frank &amp; myself to get stuck in &amp; again I was forced to use skill to deflect the ball just out of reach of the young whipper snapper at the far post.   It also meant that Rick had to stop the opposition right wing by stepping into the path of his run.</p>

<p>Once Kyle&#8217;s Ibuprofen / Paracetamol half time energy drink kicked in 30 minutesinto the 2nd half he created an opening which Andy G neatly converted to make the score 2 0.</p>

<p>Next week we&#8217;re back on the hallowed turf against Knutsford&#8230;..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From our correspondent Mr C. Gawne.</p>

<p>Important questions played on the minds of the brave men of Bowdon as they warmed up ahead of today’s match. Had Braithwaite and Jago found the dummies they spat last week? How would our half-a-coach cope with the uncoachables? Could anyone score a goal in the absence of our two top scorers?</p>

<p>Bowdon started quickly, with the ball going across the Sale D, begging to be finished off after only 30 seconds but with no-one able to get on the end it. Bowdon then settled down to play some good controlled hockey, passing it to each other, working hard and generally behaving like a proper hockey team. The regular back 5 were solid for the most part, with Fallon F in particular putting in some well-timed tackles. Most of the play was in the Sale end and Bowdon had the best of a competitive half. Fallon B was energetic and skilful and gave us the lead picking up a loose ball a couple of yards from the line and putting it away (disclaimer: that description might be wrong, can’t remember the goal I’m afraid, he might have beaten the whole Sale team twice and reversed it into the top corner.)</p>

<p>Sale pulled one back with a flick after a somewhat harsh decision by the umpire (but then again I’ve no qualifications). Further good play from Bowdon led to prolonged pressure which was rewarded with a Brooks D special into the top corner.</p>

<p>Bowdon therefore led 2-1 at half time. Sensible suggestions from Mr Half-a-Coach at the interval left us facing the rest of the game with renewed determination. Unfortunately Sale were quickly awarded a short and executed it perfectly, slotting a shot into the corner of the goal. Oh dear.</p>

<p>There followed a scrappy half of hockey punctuated by occasional moments of skill and unfortunately more frequent bouts of grumpiness and moaning about umpires decisions. This was of course unforgiveable, and Gawne is certainly glad that he was not involved in any of that, no siree.</p>

<p>As the game degenerated, cards started to come out. Braithwaite was assaulted by an unidentified Sale player, who was invited to play no further part in the game. It all looked to be heading towards a disappointing draw when Bowdon broke up the pitch and following a bit of a scramble Kyle was presented with a glorious chance. Death or Glory? With ice in his veins he slotted it home.</p>

<p>He then blotted his copy book somewhat, wheeling away in triumph and commencing a frankly ridiculous celebration more at home in American football than on the playing fields of Bowdon - a well-deserved dick of the day award. Whatever happened to a firm handshake, Kyle? That’s what greets all my goals. <em>(How would you know? Has it ever happened? - AB)</em></p>

<p>There was a frenetic final 7 minutes with Bowdon keeping out various short corners but repeatedly giving the ball back to Sale so that they could try again. Perhaps at training we could work on time wasting tactics. But we held on and claimed a hard fought 3-2 victory. Well played everyone.</p>

<p>Brooks D put in a last minute bid for dick of the day, swiping Gawne’s tracksuit top (and car keys) from the changing room, but fortunately in a fit of conscience owned up, whilst trying to deflect the blame on to Mosedale. Don’t worry Dave I’ve been back on to the police and assured them it was an
honest mistake. Man of the match: Gawne (unaccountably)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dave was man of the match again following this game, but I was unaccountably voted Dick of the Day so I am writing this under protest.</p>

<p>In my defence I feel I was provoked into my little tantrum at Dale. I just pointed out that I didn&#8217;t find his criticism either constructive or helpful. I may have have raised my voice a little, but under the circumstances I believe it was entirely justified.</p>

<p>Right, the game.</p>

<p>First half we sucked. Nobody could pass and everybody was in a bad mood. Brooklands dominated the first 15 - 20 minutes, but the defence put in a solid performance to keep us level. We got a bit better has the half progressed and started to make a few chances.</p>

<p>After another <del>tedious</del> inspirational team talk from the skipper (well done for being on time by the way), Bowdon came out with renewed vim and verve and started to look like the title contenders we are. Both teams made changes, but neither team could finish them. Dave made some excellent saves, once again earning a justified MoM award.</p>

<p>On the plus side, our short corners looked a bit better - we actually managed to get a couple of shots off from them and we didn&#8217;t lose and kept a clean sheet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From Man of the Match Dave Jeffery&#8230;</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/cartman.jpg' width='250' height='170' alt='You will respect the Captain's Authoritah' title='You will respect the Captain's Authoritah'><span class='caption-text'>You will respect the Captain&#8217;s Authoritah</span></span></p>

<p>With 2 wins under their belt the team spirits were high, even though the captain has started to blank his predecessor (thinking the power may have gone to his head already).  The team managed to turn up on time, a good start for a change.</p>

<p>After a rousing team talk the game started with possession fairly evenly split between both teams, both keepers had to be on good form with clearances at both ends in the first half, even I had a run to the edge of the D to make a quick clearance (with most of the team waiting with baited breath to see if it was going to be a clearance or a DOD nomination coming up).  As it was, a clearance was made and trouble was averted.  Down at the other end of the pitch Kyle threw his toys out of the pram and started questioning the umpires decisions (hmm someone has spent to long in Scotland?!?)</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/panic.png' width='' height='' alt='Dave moves off his line' title='Dave moves off his line'><span class='caption-text'>Dave moves off his line</span></span></p>

<p>After the game settled down Bowdon got down to business and ground out a goal (an own goal I believe), at this point we looked the better squad and were challenging for more goals, but their keeper was up to the challenge and managed to pull off some excellent saves to keep them in the game.</p>

<p>At half time it looked like Dale was about to collapse, thankfully for all after the break he was ready to stand on the pitch again. During the break we discussed tactics and someone mentioned the fact the opposition only had 10 men,  promptly after mentioning this the 11th man turned up.</p>

<p>At the start of the second half we started as we’d finished the first half, with the team in control.  This continued until the last 20 minutes where we started rotating players off the pitch and lost our shape.</p>

<p>In the last 20 minutes the opposition came back into the game and we barely got out of our half of the pitch, but against the run of play a second goal came from what looked like a cheeky chip over the keeper by Mr Brooks.  We then had to fight off a determined effort from Alderly Edge with several short corners conceded and one great save we eventually conceded a goal, but managed to hold on for a well fought 2-1 Win.</p>

<p>Without a doubt the whole team put in a great effort to pull out a good win against the team who were top of the league. Somehow man of the match was awarded to David Jeffery, and DOD was a close call between Dave Brooks and Kyle Hatch, but after careful consideration at the bar after the game Kyle has to take the award after moaning at the Umpire….</p>

<p>Onwards and Upwards for the Mighty 6’s</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week&#8217;s match report is brought to you by Ben Fallon:</p>

<p>Bowdon 6th team&#8217;s moral was high given their top of the league position and 11-0 thrashing of Macclesfield a week earlier. Due to Hatch&#8217;s insistence on finding a keepers kit that matched his shoes, F. Fallon, B. Fallon and Hatch arrived to the game at 12.35 for the 12.30 push back. Deeside were insistent on starting the game as soon as possible and so Bowdon began their second game of the season with eleven outfield players and no goalkeeper.</p>

<p>Despite having no goalkeeper, Bowdon enjoyed some good possession and even pressed on the attack. Bowdon worked hard to keep Deeside out of the D and even put their bodies on the line with a ball cannoning off B.Fallon&#8217;s chest. About 8 minutes into the game Hatch managed to work out how to put a goalkeeper&#8217;s kit on and ambled onto the pitch.</p>

<p>The first half was fairly open with both sides pressing for a goal. Midway through the first half, disaster struck with Deeside scoring the game&#8217;s opener, 1-0. Nevertheless, the defence were quite strong and even without any warm-up Hatch was able to pull out a couple key saves. Bowdon responded well with some good passages of play but were unable capitalise on their shortcorners.</p>

<p>After an inspirational <em>(inspirational??? - AB)</em> half-time team talk from F. Fallon, Bowdon came out second-half and took the game to Deeside. With pressure mounting, Bowdon&#8217;s equaliser came through a fantastic run by Bailey ending with an exquisite top corner finish (on his open side!), 1-1.</p>

<p>With Deeside&#8217;s age beginning to show, Bowdon were able to use their youth and superior fitness to maintain the attack. Bowdon&#8217;s persistence was rewarded when Bowdon&#8217;s new signing B. Fallon deflected in Brooks&#8217; strike at a shortcorner, 1-2.</p>

<p>The defence (Gawne, F. Fallon, West and McNaught) were solid in shutting out all of Deeside&#8217;s attacks and the midfield worked well with the attack to keep up the pressure. The icing on the cake came towards the end of the game when Jago led a superb counter-attack and released Brooks to make a cool finish, 1-3.</p>

<p>Overall, a solid performance from the sensational sixths to maintain their place at top of the table.</p>

<p>Man of the match was Ben Fallon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As promised, I have limited the report to only 3 words for each player. In short, the 6th team launched their 2013-14 league campaign in the fashion which their supporters have become accustomed to, beating Macclesfield 11-0, top go to the top of the league.</p>

<p>The following performers all played their part:</p>

<ul>
<li>Harry the Cat - watched as spectator</li>
<li>Nick West - kept Harry awake</li>
<li>Francis J. Fallon (c) - lead by example</li>
<li>Chris Gawne - got nosebleed attacking</li>
<li>Ben Fallon - over-shadowed by brother</li>
<li>Karl Bailey - Hull defeated Newcastle</li>
<li>Neil Breton - chief of assists</li>
<li>Dale Jago - mis-hit short corner</li>
<li>Andrew Braithwaite - conceded needless PC</li>
<li>Kyle Hatch - got cramp mincing</li>
<li>Gareth Perry - bankrupt after goalscoring</li>
</ul>


<p>We also had a twelfth member but I can&#8217;t remember who (apologies no offence meant)? <em>- AB: it was young Ben, who had an excellent game</em></p>

<p>Many thanks to Martin Ferrett and Tony Davies for umpiring.</p>

<p><em>AB: Frank has since found out that the Macc keeper broke his leg. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll all join me in wishing him a speedy recovery</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The sixth team have had good season this year. A solid core of players who played every week made things pretty simple for the captain.</p>

<p>The team was the best represented at club training with 6 or 7 players turning out each week. Thanks to Jimmy for attempting to get us to play hockey! I think it really did help, and we looked like we knew what we were doing a couple of times over the course of the season.</p>

<p>Results-wise we did well. Played 22, won 10, drew 4 finishing a very respectable 5th. Particularly pleasing was a positive goal difference of 11.</p>

<p>There were many highlights during the season. Neston scoring 4 own goals was helpful, and a hard fought 1 - 0 victory in Bangor stood out.</p>

<p>Our player of the season was Peter McNaught and his disco pants. Peter has improved massively as a player over the last couple of seasons. He trains every week, and I don&#8217;t think he missed a game all season.</p>

<p>Top scorer was Dave Brooks. I&#8217;m not sure what this says about us as a team, but it was a good effort.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week’s match report is from the Lady Doctor…</p>

<p>Bebbington 4s (maybe some 5s) vs Bowdon 6s</p>

<p>Another early start meant lie-ins were replaced with a drive to the Wirral. Some people had a longer lie-in than others, namely Frank and Kyle, but we all arrived before push back. Jago started on the side line after spending too long doing his hair in the changing room rather than warming up. (Introductory Fallon and Jago-bashing, tick)</p>

<p>Bowdon had a very shaky start to the game. Our defensive line was put under immense pressure from the beginning with a barrage of Bebbington attacks. At least 4 short corners were given against us in the first 5 minutes and all were successfully defended. A bit unnerving but no goals were conceded, god knows how!</p>

<p>The Bebbington onslaught continued for the majority of the first half with some more short corners but every attack on goal was denied. A goal line save from Captain-to-be-Fallon kept us in the game, shortly followed by a ball to the chin. Review from the team’s doctor reassured that his chin was still there. Kyle went down at one point but those dodgy hamstrings were unaffected and he was quickly back on his feet.</p>

<p>The defensive hockey skills of Si Brooks, McNaught, Fallon and West alongside the incompetence of Bebbington’s attacks maintained a score of 0-0 throughout the first half. Bowdon had limited opportunities on goal as each chance was thwarted by Bebbington’s equally strong defence.</p>

<p>El Capitan made it clear he was pleased with a 0-0 result at half time.</p>

<p>The match continued and saw better play from Bowdon with more opportunities, ball possession and control. By now, Bebbington’s cheerleaders and a 13 years young ginger lad had arrived. Braithwaite, now not the only ginger on the pitch, and Peacock managed to co-ordinate more in the midfield leading to more attacks on Bebbington. Brassington, Prosser and Mosedale struggled to secure a Bowdon goal.</p>

<p>Jago exercised his vocal cords then produced the closest attempt on goal, with a shot on target on his reverse side. Bowdon was sadly denied. Certain Bebbington players became frustrated leading to stern refereeing from Adolf Brooks, who even received a salute from a Beb player. After 60 minutes the Ginger Scouse scored making it 0-1. Fatigued Bowdon legs and some terrible man marking by Mosedale allowed Bebbington to deliver the second blow. 0-2.</p>

<p>Jeffrey certainly earnt his subs this week making some terrific saves, co-ordinating the defence and keeping Bowdon in the game. Bowdon managed to keep the score 0-2 for the last 15 minutes of the game. Despite our narrow defeat, our Ginger Captain was proud of us.</p>

<p>Match conclusion: Bowdon’s unbeaten streak comes to an honourable end and Bebbington are terrible at short corners.</p>

<p>Man of the Match: Dave Peacock for an all round solid performance, being in the right place at the right time, and giving Bowdon a strong midfield.</p>

<p>Next week we face Neston at home, who I’m sure will come seeking revenge for the 8-2 away game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From the senior Brooks…</p>

<p>We started our Saturday on a solid footing with the captain arranging a meet so we arrived in Wrexham 50mins earlier. This is the excuse I am using for everyone not quite being awake when the whistle blew to start the match.</p>

<p>The game started off very badly with us conceding a very cheap goal early on. We responded the only way we know how, with a TRAINING GROUND routine down the left hand side with JAGO PASSING <em>(I think you’ll find it was your illustrious leader!!!)</em> the ball into the centre for Brassington to divert into the back of the net 1-1. Now from here you would expect us to soldier on and take command of the game, oh no, we don’t want to make it too easy so we allow them to get another easy ball through, slicing our defence up leaving Simon Brooks on the floor and them with an easy tap in.</p>

<p>Then the cries from the back started which shook everyone to the core as nick west never shouts so it must be serious! 2 further goals from Hatch and Brooks D took us to a 3-2 lead at half time.</p>

<p>The captain was not very happy with this and gave a highly motivational speech of “your shit, we are lucky to be ahead, sort it out, we can win this”</p>

<p>We started off the second half very well, some fluid possession hockey creating some good chances when a good ball through finds Prosser who prods home to make the lead commanding.</p>

<p>Wrexham heads then started to drop and the umpires were to blame for every decision that went against them. Bowdon continued to play sublime hockey that would make the 1st team proud. Another good through ball provided Brooks D with an insight at goal and a hit towards the far corner and a Wrexham foot stops it from hitting the back of the net (or did it?), cries for FLLIIIIICKKK echoed in the umpires ears as the ball spins round the foot and into the net all by itself. Good advantage from Tony Davies.</p>

<p>Few minutes later and Wrexham had completely lost it, losing a player to a yellow card for abuse, who then preceded to try to talk his way towards a red but the umpires were forgiving in what had been a friendly game.</p>

<p>Then comes the defining moment in the match, ball fired through from Brooks S, miss trapped on the reverse by Brooks D, however, this proved advantageous as the ball popped up providing the perfect opportunity to make a simple goal look awesome as it rocketed past the keeper into the back of the net. HATRICK HERO FOR BROOKS D and Bowdon were all finished at 6-2.</p>

<p>Good Game, Brilliant second half and the perfect way to cap off a 6 game unbeaten streak!</p>

<p>Man of the Match – D Brooks</p>

<p>Dick of the Day – S Brooks (2 games in a row not being ready for the start)</p>
