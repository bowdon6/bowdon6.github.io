  <div class="entry-content"><p>Penned by Man of the Match Mr Nick West…</p>

<p>After the previous weeks  5-0 win (6-0 according to some sources), hopes were high of a repeat win.</p>

<p>We arrived at the club awaiting our lecture on what delights awaited us at the Longest pier in Wales.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/845_117.jpg' width='300' height='225' alt='Dave “convinces” Manters to come to Wales…' title='Dave “convinces” Manters to come to Wales…'><span class='caption-text'>Dave “convinces” Manters to come to Wales…</span></span></p>

<p>We got word from the getaway driver (Mr Jeffrey) that the target (Manters) had been spotted on his way to get a paper.  The crack kidnap squad of Messrs Brassington &amp; Prosser had been dispatched &amp; bundled the prey into the back of the Jeffrey Mobile to cries of ‘I need a passport to leave Bowdon’ they set off over the border in search of the fabled pier.</p>

<p>The rest of us headed out once the lecture had concluded,  this was only given to fill in time whilst we waited for Frank ‘The Scarlet Pimpernel’ Fallon to turn up but as of time of writing he still hasn’t been spotted.</p>

<p>Having had the passports checked at Border Control we managed to get into Wales although there were suspicious looks given to the Tall Ginger driver of one vehicle (El Capitan) as well as comments made as to what the Gaffer tape was covering up on Dale’s car.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/llandudno-pier-christopher-rowlands.jpg' width='300' height='225' alt='The longest pier in Wales!' title='The longest pier in Wales!'><span class='caption-text'>The longest pier in Wales!</span></span></p>

<p>We turned up at the pitch 45 minutes before push back &amp; the Elder Statesmen of the team were reminded of the good old days when a warm-up consisted of a Glass of port before the match rather than a hike up &amp; down a pier (it was a very long).</p>

<p>Suddenly a game of hockey broke out &amp; as usual the 6th XIV started to play the ball around rather messily allowing Llandudno time to pass the ball out to their wings &amp; get a few crosses in.  Fortunately the defence were able to re-buff these.  Mid-way through the 1st Half Lord Grant was given a green card after taking the legs away of the Oppo’s danger man (Ringer).  A while later  the same player managed to get into our D &amp; reversed sticked the ball off the post into the net 0 – 1.</p>

<p>After some poor Umpiring &amp; some generosity from Bowdon (Yours Truly) Llandudno were gifted a short corner right on Half Time from which they promptly scored 0-2.</p>

<p>After a good half time team talk Bowdon pulled themselves together &amp; Dave ‘I play better when Angry’ Brooks managed to pull one back 1-2.  Bowdon pressed for much of the second half but were unable to pull off a deserved comeback.  El Capitan managed to get a Green Card for following Lord Grant’s example &amp; taking the legs from the aforementioned danger man. This may have been due to the fact that although the floodlights were on an Umpire steadfastly refused to remove his Sunglasses……..</p>

<h3>Notable Mentions </h3>

<ul>
<li>Dave Peacock for another steadfast performance in Midfield.</li>
<li>Kyle for confounding all expectation &amp; only coming off the pitch when Subbed.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Disciplinary Matters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lord Grant – Green Card</li>
<li>El Capitan – Green Card (should these have been Yelow?) <em>[definitely should have been a yellow - AB]</em></li>
<li>Nick W for gifting the oppo the Short Corner which led to the 2nd Llandudno Goal <em>[forgot about that one!]</em>.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week brought to you by Mr Dale Jago:</p>

<p>After a loss last week under difficult circumstances the sixth team were looking for a convincing win to boost morale.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/condorman.jpg' width='256' height='184' alt='Still no sign of Frank ‘the Condor’ Fallon.' title='Still no sign of Frank ‘the Condor’ Fallon.'><span class='caption-text'>Still no sign of Frank ‘the Condor’ Fallon.</span></span></p>

<p>Good news from the start was that we had 13 players and no Kyle meaning we had a good chance of still having 13 standing at full time.</p>

<p>Once again no warm up drills were organised which most people were relieved at as they didn’t want Jago showing them up with his immense pace (shameless plug, had to do it).</p>

<p>The first half started with some messy play from both teams for the first 5 minutes until Bowdon got focused and started to pass the ball around nicely using the width of the pitch well.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ambulance-Tory-Britain-001.jpg' width='230' height='138' alt='The new sixth team bus' title='The new sixth team bus'><span class='caption-text'>The new sixth team bus</span></span></p>

<p>The hope of still having 13 players come full time was quickly destroyed with Gawne going off after pulling something or other (Kyle Mk 2?).</p>

<p>Bowdon started to show some dominance with several chances up front and at about 10 minutes in it paid off with Manterfield finding the goal (yes that’s right Manterfield!).</p>

<p>After the restart Bowdon kept the pressure on and not long afterwards were rewarded again as Peacock skilfully beat a defender and selflessly laid the ball on to Jago who struck the ball cleanly (must have been an accident) putting it in the bottom left corner to make it 2-0.</p>

<p>After a poor attempt from a previous short corner Braithwaite stepped up looking to make amends and he didn’t disappoint, hitting the ball with some serious clout to make it 3-0 just before the half time whistle went.</p>

<p>The second half started with Bowdon not looking as sharp as they did in the first with Bebington having a good few chances. Cleverly at half time the master tactician that is Andrew ‘El Capitan’ Braithwaite had moved David ‘The Rock’ Brooks to Centre Back meaning that all of these chances were fruitless as Brooks had their Centre Forward in his pocket the whole time.</p>

<p>Bowdon managed to get another 2 goals courtesy of Manterfield again and Pritchard who was making his annual appearance.</p>

<p><strong>Final Score – Bowdon 5 – 0 Bebington</strong></p>

<p>Man of the match went to David Brooks for his solid defensive performance and making good use of the 16’s.</p>

<p>A special mention goes to Ben Scholfield for giving the team some much needed pace on the wing and up front.</p>

<p>Next week’s fixture is against Llandudno away – I have a funny feeling that Manterfield will be unavailable!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Courtesy of Mr Prosser:</p>

<p>Following a win and a draw in the last two games, hopes were high for the match against Northop Hall 3s. Those hopes were soon to be dashed with the team consisting of only 10 players, Bowdon were up against it from the start.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1937-chevy-bodie-ghost-town-21.jpg' width='300' height='300' alt='The pitch fixtureslive told us to go to…' title='The pitch fixtureslive told us to go to…'><span class='caption-text'>The pitch fixtureslive told us to go to…</span></span></p>

<p>The day didn’t get off to the best of starts after we turned up at the wrong pitch <em>(in my defence, we went where fixtureslive said the game was – Braithers) </em>. A quick call to the oppo from el Capitan and we were on our way. Turning up late for the game meant no time for that warm-up or drills that Mr Braithwaite had lined up for us… One day <em>(be careful what you wish for!)</em>.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/DepartmentStore.jpeg' width='302' height='227' alt='Where’s Fallon?' title='Where’s Fallon?'><span class='caption-text'>Where’s Fallon?</span></span></p>

<p>The first half was underway with Bowdon taking early control of the game with some neat passing through the midfield leading to one or two half chances around the D. With captain Braithwaite forced into umpiring the match, he was in no mood for messing about and gave some stern warnings to players from both sides (watch that whining Kyle). 0-0 at Half Time.</p>

<p>The second half started with some strong play from Northop Hall and the pressure paid off when they scored a rather scrappy goal. After a good save from Jeffery the ball came back at him and bobbled about a bit before a Northop Hall player tapped in the loose ball. A few good saves from short corners by Jeffery kept us within arm’s reach of a deserved draw, but after some late pressure from 10 man Bowdon it wasn’t quite enough to find the equalizer, but well-tried lads.</p>

<p>Man of the match went to Peacock for running around a lot</p>

<p>A couple of records broken on the day:<br/>
Kyle managed to get to the 65 min mark before going off with cramp and there was still no sign of Fallon….2 weeks and counting.</p>

<p>Special Thanks go to Captain Andrew Braithwaite for giving up his chance of glory to umpire the match, although he needs to find that kitty.</p>

<p>n.b.<br/>
Words that Pete Brassington wanted to be used for his performance but were highly inappropriate – Mazy, Rock, Skillful, Reliable and Lynch-pin. The only word that comes to mind for his performance is Liability.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Written by Kyle Hatch.</p>

<p>Disclaimer; I still don’t know half the teams name, so much of this report will include clever writing to hide this fact…. or not</p>

<p>The game against Macclesfield III’s was meant with much anticipationafter last week’s heroics against Bangor University II’s. The pre-match traditional wait for Fallon got to ludicrous lengths as Frank hadn’t even made it to Bowdon by the time we left for the evening…a new record.</p>

<p>His mysterious disappearance from the starting list aside, Fallon was replaced in the starting eleven by Kyle “2.5 minutes” Hatch, who would endeavour to outlast his new nickname.</p>

<p>As has quickly become a season tradition, no warm was prepared and talks of ‘drills’ turn out to be nothing but crazy talk. Captain Braithwaite organised his troops and Bowdon prepared for battle.</p>

<p>A respectful minutes silence was adhered to in memory of a Macclesfield player who had passed away tragically at just 31….it is after all, only a game.</p>

<p>Bowdon started the brighter of the two teams, controlling possession through the middle and making good use of the right wing, Chen and Jago combining well….</p>

<p>Sustained pressure brought about some half chances but it took until 16 minutes for the first real chance and a goal. Again good work on the right and a lucky ricochet saw the ball break to Prosser (?) whose excellent dummy <em>(!?!)</em> left the goalkeeper flounding and a simple prod home saw Bowdon go one up.</p>

<p>Spurred on by their success and dominance Bowdon expanded their game to include the left side of the pitch, moving the ball around from wing to wing in an attempt to get more goals.</p>

<p>Bowdon’s offensive style almost cost them but great goalkeeping stop Macclesfield scoring on the break.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Wrong-Trousers-wallace-and-gromit-343158_500_375.jpg' width='200' height='200' alt='Kyle – perhaps these would help…' title='Kyle – perhaps these would help…'><span class='caption-text'>Kyle – perhaps these would help…</span></span></p>

<p>25th minute and the inevitable happened. Hatch’s legs gave up and he had to go off with cramp. Still a massive 10 fold improvement on the fortnight before.</p>

<p>The half time whistle came with more Bowdon pressure and despite winning at the interval, they felt disappointed not to be ahead by more. A sentiment echoed by the Captain, who’s comment of<br/>
disappointment about losing or evening drawing would come back to haunt.</p>

<p>Macclesfield came into the game with a 100% record and showed why second half, coming out a completely different team. Bowdon sat back and allowed them to attack. Despite some great defending the Bowdon goal was breached, an unlucky deflection sending the ball into the back of the net <em>(that may have been my knee…)</em>.</p>

<p>Bowdon strived to get back into the game and for the majority of the second half the game was even, both team’s looking for a winner.</p>

<p>With time running out Macclesfield looked the more likely, but superb defence including keeping out 3 penalty corners say the full time whistle go.</p>

<p>Final Score<br/>
Bowdon 6th 1 – 1 Macclesfield III</p>

<p>Man of the match went to Dave Peacock who’s calm under pressure in midfield help immeasurably. Honourable mention to Kieran Chen who’s driving runs from left back held relieve pressure and create chances.</p>

<p>Next week fixture: Northop Hall 3 (Away) <em>- Away game an no Manters!</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brought to you this week by Neil ‘Goal Machine’ Breton:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/nw__1210757779_bangor_pier.jpg">
The second longest pier in Wales.</p>

<p>The first away match of the season saw the 6th’s embarking on a long and perilous journey to Middle Earth (if last weeks match report is to be believed). Home of Wales’ second longest pier (thanks Andy), Bangor was this week’s destination.</p>

<p>The first test of the day was the pre-dawn meet time. Unexpectedly, Fallon was the last man did arrive.</p>

<p>Despite the closure of the A55 and Andy’s insistence on using Apple maps, all 11 men made it the pitch on time and promptly set about avoiding any structured warm up or drills, preferring to watch Bangor go through their paces.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/clock0945.gif">
Frank – this is what 09:45 looks like. The big hand is on 9, the little hand is between 9 and 10…</p>

<p>A rousing pre-match talk from El Capitano – “if we let them run around they might tire themselves out and we could nick a point” gave the team hope. The first half passed without incident, Bowdon’s well organised defence keeping Bangor at bay, forcing them to ping the ball sideways at the half way line without really making any progress into the Bowdon 16. Highlights included Andy intimidating a Bangor midfielder so much he threw himself to the floor in terror, and a great save from Dave from a short corner.</p>

<p>An inspirational half time speech – “we’ve not got a point yet. Yes we’ll get tired, but we can hold on” set Bowdon up for the second half. An increasingly frustrated Bangor team kept trying to pick killer passes, creating more chances as Bowden tired. Having used one of their three available substitute goalkeepers and with 2 rolling substitutes, Bangor kept pushing and enjoyed a majority of pressure and territory. This counted for nothing however when the ball got shelled up the left wing (possibly from a 16, I can’t really remember) to Neil who turned his defender like he was a line of cones at training and struck a weak shot from the top of the D that hobbled over the keepers stick at the near post. The crowd went silent, Bangor went silent, and Bowdon couldn’t believe that Breton had scored his bi-annual goal at such a key moment. 5 minutes later the ball was in the back of the net again, Andy’s reverse stick effort from 3 yards disallowed as Dave Brooks was too lazy to get out the way.</p>

<p>This fired up the Bangor team, who set up camp in the Bowdon half. Long balls out were held up well by Dave who had no support. Until he got yellow carded for a cynical goal-saving tackle. One last short corner at the final whistle gave Bangor a final role of the dice, but the shot was well saved, and Bowdon held on to steal 3 points from a gutted Bangor team.</p>

<p>Special mention must go to the two umpires who did a great job and were class.</p>

<p>Over a decent sausage and chip lunch at the local student bar, Frank Fallon was voted man of the match despite turning up late. <em>– I vetoed this, he can be MOM when he pays his fine…</em></p>

<p>1st league game of the season and the Sixth team have had their first setback in their quest for mid-table mediocrity, losing 4-1 to the Crewe Vagrants.</p>

<p>The day started well for Bowdon as it wasn’t raining and the boys were eager to get going, some even turning up at the allotted meet time. However, shortly after pushback, things were already not going to plan with two players forced off with injury. Hatch took a nasty scuff to his nail varnish and was forced to leave the field indefinitely in search of an emergency manicure. Fallon, though, volunteered to carry on, despite being hit so hard with the ball that his Uncle John got a nose bleed.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, Bowdon were behind, with Crew scoring against the run of play. The Sixes did go into the break, however, at 1-1 with Manterfield levelling with what is believed to be a first of many/only goal of the season.</p>

<p>After the break Bowdon pressed forward looking for a winner, and looked promising with Peacock pulling strings in midfield and Prosser strong at the back. It was not to be, however, as Crewe scored three more times to seal a close victory.</p>

<p>The Sixes will now have to look to next week and a trip to Wales, the British Middle Earth, to notch up their first victory of the season and the first under Braithwaite’s tenure as Captain.</p>

<p><em>Thanks Frank, an excellent Stalinesque rewriting of history. I think you’ve somewhat underplayed your part in Crewe’s second goal, but if you write the report you get to decide how the game is remembered…</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My second match in charge and after last weeks debacle I had a lot to prove on the captaincy front…</p>

<p>On the plus side, we had 11 players (once Balf got out of his pit), we had opposition and we had a pitch to play on. Things were definitely looking up.</p>

<p>We had a blend of experience and more experience in the team, and I started to worry when the oppo started their warm-up drills. We should probably get some of those, but we need to be careful not to over-train.</p>

<p>The game started and it became quickly apparent that Didsbury had some game. They were strong in the midfield and good going forward. We went behind early on when I kicked ball into our goal were under the cosh of from then on.  The first half was hard and we went into the break 6 down…</p>

<p>An injury to Grinham meant that we had to borrow a player from Didsbury (thanks Ray!) and a quick reorganisation saw a different Bowdon team start the second half. We played much better and managed to keep the ball, even getting a coupleof shots in (ask Prosser about his miss). The defence worked really hard and limited to Didsbury to two goals (one was a bit of a fluke), and we showed some promising signs of hockey greatness.</p>

<p>The game finished 8-0 which I thought was a bit harsh. Didsbury are a strong team and will cause anyone they play problems this season.</p>
