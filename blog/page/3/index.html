  <div class="entry-content"><p>From the senior Brooks…</p>

<p>We started our Saturday on a solid footing with the captain arranging a meet so we arrived in Wrexham 50mins earlier. This is the excuse I am using for everyone not quite being awake when the whistle blew to start the match.</p>

<p>The game started off very badly with us conceding a very cheap goal early on. We responded the only way we know how, with a TRAINING GROUND routine down the left hand side with JAGO PASSING <em>(I think you’ll find it was your illustrious leader!!!)</em> the ball into the centre for Brassington to divert into the back of the net 1-1. Now from here you would expect us to soldier on and take command of the game, oh no, we don’t want to make it too easy so we allow them to get another easy ball through, slicing our defence up leaving Simon Brooks on the floor and them with an easy tap in.</p>

<p>Then the cries from the back started which shook everyone to the core as nick west never shouts so it must be serious! 2 further goals from Hatch and Brooks D took us to a 3-2 lead at half time.</p>

<p>The captain was not very happy with this and gave a highly motivational speech of “your shit, we are lucky to be ahead, sort it out, we can win this”</p>

<p>We started off the second half very well, some fluid possession hockey creating some good chances when a good ball through finds Prosser who prods home to make the lead commanding.</p>

<p>Wrexham heads then started to drop and the umpires were to blame for every decision that went against them. Bowdon continued to play sublime hockey that would make the 1st team proud. Another good through ball provided Brooks D with an insight at goal and a hit towards the far corner and a Wrexham foot stops it from hitting the back of the net (or did it?), cries for FLLIIIIICKKK echoed in the umpires ears as the ball spins round the foot and into the net all by itself. Good advantage from Tony Davies.</p>

<p>Few minutes later and Wrexham had completely lost it, losing a player to a yellow card for abuse, who then preceded to try to talk his way towards a red but the umpires were forgiving in what had been a friendly game.</p>

<p>Then comes the defining moment in the match, ball fired through from Brooks S, miss trapped on the reverse by Brooks D, however, this proved advantageous as the ball popped up providing the perfect opportunity to make a simple goal look awesome as it rocketed past the keeper into the back of the net. HATRICK HERO FOR BROOKS D and Bowdon were all finished at 6-2.</p>

<p>Good Game, Brilliant second half and the perfect way to cap off a 6 game unbeaten streak!</p>

<p>Man of the Match – D Brooks</p>

<p>Dick of the Day – S Brooks (2 games in a row not being ready for the start)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brought to you by Man of the Match Chris Gawne…</p>

<p>Wearily the warriors girded their loins for battle. “Can it really be a week?” complained the muscles of the ‘senior’ members of the team. No. Less than 24 hours after trudging from the pitch at the end of a glorious 0-0, the best mens’ 6th team in Bowdon were back in action.</p>

<p>Typically balmy conditions greeted us at the Dev, the mercury hitting 20C but, on the bright side, there was no snow. Llandudno had left the second longest pier in Wales and ventured into civilisation to provide today’s opposition. 15 men of Bowdon were happy to prioritise hockey over religious observance as a suitable Sunday activity, much like the soon-to-be-ex pope.</p>

<p>The Rev. Braithwaite’s team talk (sermon?) was inspirational. It had such an effect on Simon Brooks that he forgot to dress himself properly, therefore creating a new record by being rolled off before the game had started. But he was back on within 5 minutes and led a quality period of play during which Bowdon went 3-0 up in the first 25 minutes playing some of the best hockey your correspondent has seen this season; admittedly a season spent watching the 6s and 7s. Excellent goals were scored by Carl Bailey, Simon Brooks and Dale Jago, not necessarily in that order.</p>

<p>The large squad left us well able to cope with the physical demands of the match and the frequent rolling subs added fresh legs but disrupted the flow of the game and the Welsh came back into it. After a cock up in midfield Llandudo scored with a speedy break: 3-1 at half time.</p>

<p>The team talk was a riot of x rated language and tactical insight and we went into the second half reinvigorated.</p>

<p>The half began with a nip and tuck period when the match could have gone either way. Fortunately Bowdon kept it tight at the back, aided by Nick West’s well timed tackles and big feet on the goal line (never a flick!). Those barracking supporting from the sidelines roared encouragement. Eventually our superior fitness (or numbers) told and Dave Brooks and Captain Fantastic were able to add the goals needed to seal the match. I’m told that Braithwaite has now scored more goals in the opposition’s net than he has in ours – a successful season for the Skip. Francis Fallon found himself well positioned to add more goals but proved himself unable to hit a cow’s arse with a banjo, much to the enjoyment of the crowd.</p>

<p>All in all a fine victory, with the first 25 mins in particular matching the peaks of hockey prowess usually only associated with teams playing on the international stage (probably). The man of the match vote went to Gawne, more because a ‘volunteer’ was needed to write the match report than for anything done on the pitch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>This weeks guest correspondent, Mr P McNaught.</p>

<p>The captain was obviously worried about whether the team would have difficulty finding the unusual venue of the Dev (the team being used to prime spot in the wet pitch) and so fixed a meet time of a full half hour before the match. He didn’t need to worry as the whole team arrived before any of the opposition! In fact the opposition struggled to find the way from the Club to the Dev. This meant that the trained athletes (eg the oldies – Gaune, West and McNaught) could show off their warm up routines.This was a weakened team as el capitain had been “mugged” at selection losing key players (Breton, Grant and Peacock) to the 5th team. However, we had 3 successive wins under our belt and confidence was high. The captain repeated his usual team talk “We can beat this lot”.</p>

<p>As the snow fell, the match began badly for Bowdon who were under pressure from the beginning with lots of poor passes and appearing to lack any sense urgency. However, the team started to put a few passes together and after a rare incursion into the “D” by McNaught were awarded a short corner. This was the first of a number of short corners which the team failed to convert – clearly something to be practised at the 6th team training on Monday.</p>

<p>However, the defence of West, Prosser, Fallon and Gaunce were steady throughout and Wilmslow hardly threatened the Bowdon goal. But the Bowdon attack could not convert. Manters was unusually off target and easy chances were missed. Jago and Brooks worked hard in midfield and Braithwaite played his usual pivotal <em>(pivotal – I like that!)</em> role in the middle. However, the goals did not come and the match ended a disappointing 0-0 draw.</p>

<p>Man of the Match was Fallon (Frank the Tank) for his steady defence and incisive attack.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Mr Kyle Hatch presents Bowdon v Oxton…</p>

<p>Bowdon had won 2 in a row, could they make it 3. Things didn’t look good as there was no keeper on the team sheet, there was lots of talk of playing 11 outfield, with experimental 4-4-3 and 5-4-2. However upon arrival and the pre-match huddle, Braithers asked for a volunteer to wear the club kit, all eyes MAGICALLY turned to Hatch….wonder who gave them that idea….</p>

<p>Upon finally ‘volunteering’ he checked the club kit. Which leads to the amazing question of ‘how many 6 teamers does it take to remove shoulder pads from an idiots legs….’…at least 4. Finally after 5 minutes and some inpatient Oxton players the match began.</p>

<p>Bowdon started the match trying to restrict Oxton shots on goal. They did that by playing high tempo (for us) hockey that simple kept the ball away from the Oxton midfield. Too static throughout their 11, it wasn’t long until the scoring was opened. Some nice play saw Karl Bailey open his account for Bowdon from close range.</p>

<p>Having started the scoring Bowdon weren’t going to stop, it was non-stop pressure, with a high line defence keeping Oxton pushed back and soon it was two. Simon Brooks doing a lot of nonchalant dribbling all game decided it was time for his obligatory goal and hitting home. Twenty-ish minutes in, two nil and comfortable.</p>

<p>More pressure saw Bowdon earn a short corner which saw some imaginative play, the end result being Andy Braithwaite diverting the ball home with a great piece of skill/luck. (Delete depending on believability)</p>

<p>It took 30 minutes for Oxton to challenge the Bowdon keeper, a break from their right saw the winger run into the D with the ball. The Bowdon keeper charged out and deflected the ball wide, much to the amazement of the Bowdon team who’d never seen a keeper so mobile. There was talk after about a missed opportunity to ‘break the posh Scouser in half’.</p>

<p>The first real test of the first half for Bowdon came from a short corner, but Hatch easily kicked it away and the first half drew to an end.</p>

<p>Half Time: Oxton 6th 0 – 3 Bowdon 6th</p>

<p>At half time the captain once again congratulated the team on another great first half performance, but warned against last week’s complacency and gung-ho attitude from repeating. Queue a second half full of complacency and everyone trying to score…well almost everyone.</p>

<p>Oxton didn’t really try anything different than from the first half than give it to the kid with the headband who hit forward to strikers. Nick West and Simon Brooks contain any thought of a solid shot on goal for much of the second half. Bowdon did at least try to switch play from right to left and back again, but in between were bouts of irrational dribbling and weak passing.</p>

<p>Despite this Bowdon got a 4th. Brassington slotting home a smart shot after a decent save from the Oxton keeper. A 4th goal should of helped Bowdon push on after they showed what they could do, instead it was back to dribbling…and not always with the ball.</p>

<p>This lead to Oxton getting another short corner, the first a scuffed effort off a foot, the second a quickly taken affair which was deflected wide by the Bowdon keeper…a fine stop.</p>

<p>As the game toiled on the Bowdon defence seemed at ease, the back 4 of McNaught, West, Brooks and Prosser were quick to snuff out any real danger and this allowed the Bowdon midfield to release Bailey who knew the route to goal, knocking in Bowdon’s 5th.</p>

<p>A 6th soon followed, going down as another OG (second top scorer….sure with help he’ll over take Manterfield at the top). Dr Tom missed a great opportunity to get his name on the sheet, after beating the Oxton line and running into the D, decided to actually pass instead of shooting. Clearly missed the gung-ho memo.</p>

<p>The only sour note came from more sloppy play from the replacement Right back, Dale Jago. His mistake saw a 3 on 1 attack by Oxton. The players passed round the keeper before slotting home. 64 mins clean sheet….gits. Bowdon saw out the rest of the match with ease.</p>

<p>All in all another fine result by Bowdon 6th team.</p>

<p>Final Score: Oxton 6th 1 – 6 Bowdon 6th</p>

<p>Next week: Wilmslow 3rd’s HOME (SAT), Llandudno 2nd HOME (SUN)<br/>
Man Of The Match: ???</p>

<p>Well done guys, can we make sure that Dave is available every week please….if not, can we have a grown up’s kit if I have to play in goal again….</p>

<p>The snows finally cleared, no earthquakes and no other acts of God. Bowdon 6th Team hockey was finally back on after a two week hiatus. Strange though it was to be playing hockey again, some things remain constant, Frank ‘the Falcon’ Fallon was yet again late getting to the club. I’ve tried fines, I’ve tried telling him a different start time to everybody else, I honestly don’t know what else to do. Perhaps he’ll turn a new leaf when he takes over as skipper next year.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/krays2.jpg' width='' height='' alt='The Brooks Boys' title='The Brooks Boys'><span class='caption-text'>The Brooks Boys</span></span>
Following a detailed tactical discussion with Brooks Senior on Facebook, a new look Bowdon team took to the field in a distinctly chilly Bebington. Pete McNaught moved into the midfield, with the sixth team’s very own version of the Kray twins, the Brooks boys, lining up in the centre of the defense.</p>

<p>Following yet another inspirational team talk by myself, Bowdon took to the field. It quickly became apparent that our lineup though reasonable on paper was, in practice, complete twoddle. A swift reorganization later and Bowdon began to play some decent hockey.</p>

<p>Bowdon never looked like losing the game (although we tried). Man of the Match Breton, ran like a whippet (a knackered, asthmatic whippet, but a whippet none the less) up the right wing and caused the Bebington defense problems throughout the game. Nick West thought being 0 – 0 was a bit boring so decided to kick in a short corner for Bebington, but this gave us the kick up the arse needed to get us playing. Goals by Prosser and Brooks Senior gave the Bowdon’s Premier Men’s Sixth team the win.</p>

<p>Bebington kindly provided two umpires for the match, and Brooks brothers seemed keen share their hockey experience with them to help them develop their umpiring careers. I’m not sure that this advice was all that welcome, but I’m sure they were only trying to help.</p>

<p>Both Mr West and Mr Fallon have been added to the naughty boys list. For their respective own goal and tardiness.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weeks match report is brought to you by the Balfinator. There doesn’t seem to be any mention of him “going to see his parents for a minute” whilst his girlfriend had a drink with the rest of the sixth team at the club…</p>

<p>Following an uplifting 8-2 win away to Neston last week, the 6th team underwent some changes before taking on the then 3rd in the table Crewe Vagrants 3s team. Perhaps the most notable losses were the last weeks Man of the Match Branch (stolen by the 5th team), and Perry due to back problems. Other absences included the continuation of Manterfield’s phobia of any match played more than a mile from Bowdon, an unfortunate case of food poisoning that struck Prosser, and the loss of Kyle to his previously undiagnosed broken finger. Hope of adequate replacement dwindled rapidly as only Balfour  was (sort of) available to fill their shoes.</p>

<p>Well past the arranged meet time of 10:45 Fallon turned up, although it must be said that he somehow managed to arrive earlier than Jago and the Brooks brothers.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/brandy.png' width='' height='' alt='Spiced brandy and bourbon with fudge was it Frank?' title='Spiced brandy and bourbon with fudge was it Frank?'><span class='caption-text'>Spiced brandy and bourbon with fudge was it Frank?</span></span>
En route to Crewe the true tale of Balfour’s ‘availability’ emerged, as he should have been playing for the 7s later instead. With Martin’s wrath echoing throughout the north of England the 6th team finally arrived at Crewe; to find Fallon almost passed out on a table due to the strength of his hangover – the only things keeping him awake were repeating the many unusual drinks he had consumed the night before in the hope someone may find this information at all interesting, and moaning profanities about Spanish people. Timmy would have been proud of the sheer diversity of language displayed!</p>

<p>The usual lack of warm up drills, as well as the combined lateness of Fallon, Jago and Brooks (x2) and the incompetence of Balfour’s communication skills, meant that half the team hadn’t had a chance to hit a ball before the match. However the team was treated to a rousing speech by El Capitan. Bold remarks of “We can have them!” and “They aren’t as good as when we played them at the start of the season!” combined with sage words of wisdom such as “keep the ball” buoyed the team and provided mental images of a close, yet hard fought contest.</p>

<p>This rapidly turned out not to be the case…</p>

<p>Within minutes, a quick moving and well structured attack penetrated the Bowdon defence, and shortly after the ball entered the net. Moments later another Crewe goal enlightened the Bowdon team to their predicament.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/timmy.png' width='' height='' alt='Dale doesn't agree it was a flick' title='Dale doesn't agree it was a flick'><span class='caption-text'>Dale doesn&#8217;t agree it was a flick</span></span>
Crewe next decided that short corners were the best way to get goals, and were awarded two within 5 minutes. Due to sterling work by the Bowdon defence though, both of these were kept out. However it was 3rd time lucky for Crewe as the ball bounced off Balfour’s stick with his attempted clearance, and struck his foot on the line. A penalty flick was awarded. All that could be heard when the team gathered was a string of swear words with no observable sentence structure or discernable meaning issuing forth from the mouth of Jago (newly christened “Timmy Tourettes”). To universal cries of “SHUT UP DALE” the team watched with growing disappointment as the flick sailed past Jeffery and into the bottom corner of the goal.</p>

<p>There were some periods of lovely passing and movement from Bowdon, although ultimately a failure to score. However the majority of the match passed in a haze of frantic defence and, to quote Braithers, “dribbling up our own arses”. Four more goals were scored in the second half, all from Crewe, and none of which deserve talking about.</p>

Notable moments in the match were; yet another perfectly timed save on the line from McNaught, Jago/Timmy hitting the ball 3 metres to the left of the goal when it was slipped to him on a short corner, the sudden disappearance of Braithwaite’s hitting ability, and our ‘consolation’ that the bloke whose foot Dave Brooks smashed the ball into 10 minutes from the end was STILL limping when we left the changing rooms!</p>

<p>Man of the Match was awarded to Jeffery, whose presence meant it was only 7-0, not the 20-0 it felt like. Also a team award for no own goals scored, even under such pressure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weeks guest correspondent is Girth Perry:</p>

<p>The sixth team took a 14-man squad for the tough away trip to Neston, who were one of the early pace setters, lying second in the league. The captain gave a rousing team talk, focussing on making no mistakes and using our superior fitness and skill to win the game. This wise advice was ignored by all players.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/doctor.jpg" width="250" height="250" title="doctor" >
After three minutes, Fallon was tired so he minced off for a well earned break, as a punishment the skipper kept him on the bench for the rest of the game. Doctor Mosedale consulted his medical textbook and suggested rest and raising the supposedly injured ego. I’m reliably informed that had Hatch been playing, his brittle hamstrings would also have succumbed in the same period. Luckily the other 13 players were made of sterner stuff.</p>

<p>In the opening minutes Bowdon quickly registered a charity and began liberally giving away free passes to the oppo. Neston obliged and took the lead from a penalty corner (1-0). Not be undone in the set piece stakes, Branch responded for Bowdon almost immediately with a PC which owed much to the inventive creation of Perry and Brookes Snr. The move clearly dumfounded many, including Brassington, who seemed to doubt that this was a well-executed move and not a incompetent shambles!</p>

<p>The team in red and black were in the driving seat and four more goals followed before the break. A good move down the right which started at the back with Breton and West, lead to Brookes Snr passing in the D for once and Perry applied the finish. Then seeing as though it’s nearly Christmas, Neston kindly scored a couple of neat own goals for Bowdon and Brookes Jnr added a fifth.</p>

<p>The big ginger one focussed on a neater second half, with less gift wrapped passes to the opposition. Fallon, who by this time had showered, changed, done his hair and was now proudly sporting a fine Christmas jumper, failed to provide any half time oranges or any insight on the game he’d been so keenly watching. Sensibly, the skipper withdrew Perry at half time after Doctor Mosedale diagnosed acute agression syndrome.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/appeal.jpg" title="appeal" >
Tactically Bowdon had the measure of their opposition and continued in their pursuit of own goals. Like a vintage West Indian pace attack, Bowdon fired repeated quick balls at the Neston defence. One one occasion, Prosser appealed for a nick behind and after correctly consulting hawk eye, the goal was awarded.</p>

<p>At 6:1 the game was surely over, however Neston scored a second goal which owed much to Jago failing to mark his man in the build-up to the goal! This fired the home team up again, however they were soon reduced to ten players after Perry was the subject of an over-zealous attempt to win the ball from him. The man advantage showed as Bowdon forced a fourth own goal of the game shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>At 7:2 tiredness crept in to much of the play from both sides, although Jeffery was the busier goalkeeper for some periods of play and happened to be in the right place at the right time on a number of occasions. McNaught was the only player not to tire, this owes much to facts which emerged well after the game. The aforementioned player has been caught half naked practicing drag flicking on his landing at 3am most mornings, accompanied by a half empty bottle of white lightening and a pack of Lambert &amp; Butler. Obviously, Dr M’s opinion will be sought before next weeks game.</p>

<p>Bowdon finished the scoring late on after Brooks Snr won a penalty flick with a Torres-esque over-elaborate swallow dive, although he had clearly been fouled. Perry converted the stroke for 8:2.</p>

<p>After the match, Branch was awarded man of the match, Jeffery came second and Manterfield a close third.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week’s guest correspondent: Mr Jonny Grant…</p>

<p>As the team entered onto the “Field of Dreams”, 4th in the league, there was great anticipation of a hat trick of victories, moral was high and our Captain lead the way giving a spirited team talk before the start of the match, 3 – 4 – 3 was the playing format.</p>

<p>Dale (The late Frank) Jago eventually “rushed” on with a minute to spare but fortunately 11 players were already warmed up and raring to go, which gave him the opportunity for an early rest on the bench.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/chopping-wood.jpg" width="300" height="669">
The match started with vim and vigour and Bowdon pushing forward forcing the game into the Wrexham half. The umpires were making it clear that heavy stick tackles were not going to be tolerated, and so after a couple of green cards were issued their young Captain, who looked remarkably similar to a previously player on the same side who offended, took the brunt of the catalogue of offences and was sent off after an excellent display of chopping, which the writer had not seen the like of since a visit to Sweden in 1989 (a forest).</p>

<p>Kyle, having played the last game in full, was confident again and hopes were high of a fully fit rolling substitution tactic to keep the pressure on the oppo, but then, with not even a quarter of the match gone, injury struck.</p>

<p>It was Kyle; an awkward fall resulted in a wrist injury and he was off to the bench to wake up Dale. The team were worried for his wellbeing and evening’s entertainment but fortunately he was still able to hold his stick with his remaining hand, as was to be proven later (no picture required here Captain).</p>

<p>Wrexham pushed forward and, with a well struck ball from a tight angle, sneaked one into our goal to make the score 0 – 1.</p>

<p>The halftime whistle blew and after a further “we should be wining this” and “it’s that number 11 who is the issue” (there were two number 11s on the Wrexham side) halftime team talk the second half started with the formation 2 – 5 – 3  and again Bowdon took the advantage.</p>

<p>Although certain players were clearly tiring, and with no hope of substitution, the team battled on.  Shortly after a “professional foul” (…..what can one say…..) was given against him, it was McNaught who suffered first with a torn hamstring which sent him off limping. What was to be done?</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/medical_team.jpg' width='300' height='135' alt='The team is on standby for the next time Kyle plays…' title='The team is on standby for the next time Kyle plays…'><span class='caption-text'>The team is on standby for the next time Kyle plays…</span></span>
From the bench, with D’Artagnanesk style, Kyle was “on guard”. And, with not long to go and a flurry of flashing carbon, the ball ended up in the oppositions net to end the game 1 – 1.</p>

<p>In the end a draw was fair not the right result and we should have won. There was talk after the game that Manters had been missed but it was soon hushed up in case he found out. We than all looked forward to and talked tactics about next week’s match against the top of the table, or did we just have another beer!</p>

<p>Man of the match went to Doctor Tom for a stalwart performance, however, he was too busy mending people or something to write the match report this week, but there is always the next match.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week’s match report is brought to by Mr Peacock and the letter Q:</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cockermouth-0706b.jpg' width='300' height='192' alt='Apropos nothing – doesn’t Cockermouth look lovely?' title='Apropos nothing – doesn’t Cockermouth look lovely?'><span class='caption-text'>Apropos nothing – doesn’t Cockermouth look lovely?</span></span></p>

<p>The day began well for Bowdon. The team arrived on time and raring to go. Brassington applied his anti-chaffing nipple cream and the team kitted up. The aim: to continue the strong start to the season that has left the team high up the league and many of the more experienced members of the team suffering vertigo.</p>

<p>Captain Braithwaite was soon deep in to his tactical briefing. Much talk of transitions, rotation, zonal-marking, and false-nines (an oxymoron for this team surely). It was decided that the team would continue to experiment with an avant-garde 3-4-3 formation, somewhat aping the tactical shift made by Barcelona last season. Braithwaite himself was once again taking on the Busquets defensive-midfielder/spare centre-back cum libero. The talk then switched to analysis of the opposition and this was as insightful as ever – “they’ve got some old guys”.</p>

<p>Post-strategic summit, it was drills time. These clearly had the intended effect as the spectators who had thronged to watch the previous game on the pitch were soon cowed and driven away. Not a surprise, after witnessing Grant warm up by cleaving practice balls in half with his new weapon.</p>

<p>With 13 players available, it was a relief to all when hypochondriac Hatch was dispatched to the bench.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/castaway_l.jpg' width='300' height='225' alt='Neil's getting lonely on the right' title='Neil's getting lonely on the right'><span class='caption-text'>Neil&#8217;s getting lonely on the right</span></span></p>

<p>Soon after the game began, it was clear that we were in for a hard game and formations and all tactics went out of the window. Poor Bretton stranded out on the right of midfield was ignored by all and sundry for most of the first half.</p>

<p>Bowdon quickly found themselves 2-1 down; at least, I think we were. The only consolation a kneed effort from converted defender Prosser. Half time brought no respite for a flagging team. Brooks had been assaulted early on, cruelly cut down in his prime, and was ruled out for the rest of the match. Manterfield, having complained pre-match of problems with his vision, now substituted himself complaining of an unspecified alcohol related condition.</p>

<p>It looked as if Bowdon were out for the count.</p>

<p>However, inspiration came from an unlikely source. Centre-back West decided to take the game by the scruff of its neck. Flowing forward a la Franz Beckenbauer, (a modern OAP version of Beckenbauer as opposed to the Kaiser in his prime, but impressive nonetheless) West soon had the opposition in disarray. Unfortunately, his teammates were also a little confused by his appearance in the opposition half for the first time this season and simply stood dumbfounded rather than going assist. Nevertheless, a brave precedent had been set and Bowdon gradually began to dominate.</p>

<p>Wilmslow soon began to panic and give away short corners. Initially, Bowdon’s efforts were as useless as normal <em>[we were lulling them into a false sense of security - AB]</em>. Suddenly, receiver Braithwaite slipped a ball to his left straight to no one. The shock of the captain passing the ball, following last week’s increasingly desperate attempts to bag a goal, soon passed and a cunning plan hatched. At the very next short corner, the ball was slipped left once more and this time Jago was there to rifle/scuffle home the equalizer.</p>

<p>Bowdon continued to push for the winner, but so did Wilmslow. Late disappointment was averted thanks to the cat like agility of Jeffery, McNaught’s dogged defensive work, and our own-goal specialist Braithwaite keeping out of the way.</p>

<p>Finally, at the death, Hatch proved his worth. Finally released from the bench thanks to the travails of Brooks and Manterfield, he had already spurned one chance by juggling like a trained monkey from an Indonesian circus rather than shooting. Thanks to Prosser he was spared eternal mockery. An insightful ball flung across the D upon which Hatch seized, flipping it over the keeper and into the net. Hatch, nee Aguero, wheeled away in celebration and the umpires soon blew for full-time.</p>

<p>Man of the Match – Prosser. Just pipping Jago by one vote. The casting vote – Prosser.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>I get the feeling that Mr Brooks isn’t a 100% happy with Mr Prosser…</p>

<p>After the abysmal week in Llandudno the team rallied to the cause to offer el captain the choice of 17 for this week’s visit of Oxton. Somehow the losing team all managed to retain their places in the squad with frank “who?” fallon making himself available, only to then hurt his hand? (do you think we haven’t noticed the new girlfriend?). Not that it mattered as he was going to the 7’s anyway.</p>

<p>The day began with the captain showing he can pass while warming up with his son <em>(the sad thing is he’s better than most of us and he’s only 7 – AB)</em>, however this appears to only be a training drill. We “welcomed” the Scousers to a warm sunny day at Alti Boys with them delaying the start as the captain felt it wasn’t fair to make them play with only 8? (SCOUSERS Braithers, SCOUSERS!!!)</p>

<p>Bowdon started off sloppy allowing the opposition to play some nice hockey for the first 30 seconds until Bretton popped up on the right hand side a drilled in a cross which MANTERS converted. And so it began….</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/surprised.jpg' width='300' height='254' alt='the crowd are somewhat surprised by Kyle’s goal…' title='the crowd are somewhat surprised by Kyle’s goal…'><span class='caption-text'>the crowd are somewhat surprised by Kyle’s goal…</span></span></p>

<p>The best 6th Team in Bowdon then started to live up to why they are the best with another 2 goal in quick succession from Manters and….wait for it…. KYLE HATCH!!!!!! Some sloppy and selfish play resulted in a 10man Bowdon side making it to half time with a clean sheet and having only scored 3! (You don’t count as playing if you don’t touch the ball Dave).</p>

<p>The second half began with Bowdon realising there is no “I” in team (unfortunately this message did not convey to the captain who just wanted to score and not pass to anyone). Brooks started on the bench and thought his ears were going as the supported, yes supporters, were commentating on DALE’S SKILL???</p>

<p>This next bit may take reading 2 or 3 times so I will put it in capitals. MANTERS THEN GOT US GOING WITH ANOTHER 2 GOALS!!!! Before Oxtons defender then decided to chip his own keeper with what was to be oxtons only shot on goal in the game. Mosedale added another for the mighty 6th team and then Brooks slotted home from close range with a ball going so slowly even Dave may have saved it. Brooks nearly doubled his tally until producing the best air shot you will see all season.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://bowdon6.s.greenqloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/thief.png' width='300' height='254' alt='Artists impression of Prosser’s goal' title='Artists impression of Prosser’s goal'><span class='caption-text'>Artists impression of Prosser’s goal</span></span>
Then comes the most disturbing and quite frankly unacceptable bit of camaraderie I have ever seen. It was so bad it is something I would only think of happening at Lymm and Timperley! Brooks shot at goal with a thunder of a strike only for it to hit the Oxton keeper (who must have been in some relation to the giants!) but with a lucky rebound back out to him, beat the keeper at the second attempt with a sublime drag flick which was just about to cross the line at chest height and seal off a perfect day. AND THEN… RICHARD “the honorary Scouser” PROSSER stuck a stick out to steal it for himself. Maybe he did not get the code of conduct when he joined the club but this is NOT TIMPERLEY anymore!</p>

<p>However a 9-0 win makes us all happy and we travel to Wilmslow next week with hope of another emphatic victory and a bit more team spirit (Prosser and Braithers)!</p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot find anything this week to bully dale about, however with all his “skill” he still managed not to score and the man of the match evaded him again. With Mosedale goal and 2 assists and all round tireless performance gifting him the honour!</p>
